> Secret Santa for friend groups

Sleighride allows you to organize a [gift exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa) with your friend group!

Sleighride features:
- Random matching â€” get matched randomly with a friend
- Address sharing â€” get your friend's address without having to ask
- Note exchange â€” send notes between the gift giver and the gift receiver

The backend is written in Go, and is stored in [`sleighride-server`](sleighride-server/), and the front end is written in TypeScript and React, and stored in [`sleighride-client`](sleighride-client/).
